# finalproject
I made a wesbite about how teens can help cure alzheimer's. It is a passion project that my computer science class is doing, and I decided to do it on Alzheimer's disease and how teens can help. I will explain my code below. 
## how I coded
I coded on atom and then published my repository to github
### parts of my code
horizontal tabs, that all are linked to the original html page  
sidebars with a preview of what will go in each tab but not clickable
different headers in each tab with all of the information, pictures (and an attempted video)
I also used AMP fonts and images
